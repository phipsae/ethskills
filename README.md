**The missing knowledge between AI agents and production Ethereum.**

LLMs think gas is 30 gwei. It's 0.05. They've never heard of ERC-8004 or x402. They hallucinate contract addresses. This site fixes that.

## How It Works

Each skill is a markdown file. Give any URL to your AI agent — it reads it and instantly corrects its Ethereum knowledge.

```
https://ethskills.com/SKILL.md          ← everything (51KB)
https://ethskills.com/gas/SKILL.md      ← just gas & costs
https://ethskills.com/why/SKILL.md      ← why ethereum
```

No install. No CLI. No package manager. Just a URL.

## Skills

| Skill | What LLMs Get Wrong |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Why Ethereum](why/SKILL.md) | Pectra/Fusaka shipped, gas is cheap now, AI agent angle |
| [Gas & Costs](gas/SKILL.md) | Think gas is 10-30 gwei — reality is 0.05-0.3 gwei |
| [Wallets](wallets/SKILL.md) | EIP-7702 is live, Safe addresses, agent key safety |
| [Layer 2s](l2s/SKILL.md) | Think L2 txs cost $0.01-2.00 — reality is <$0.001 |
| [Standards](standards/SKILL.md) | Don't know ERC-8004, EIP-7702 status, EIP-3009 for x402 |
| [Tools](tools/SKILL.md) | Don't know x402, Blockscout MCP, current tool landscape |
| [Money Legos](building-blocks/SKILL.md) | Stale on current DeFi state, Uniswap V4 status |
| [Orchestration](orchestration/SKILL.md) | Don't know SE2 three-phase build system |
| [Contract Addresses](addresses/SKILL.md) | Hallucinate addresses — these are verified on-chain |

## Methodology

We test stock LLMs, find what they get wrong, and write corrections. Content is verified against on-chain reality. If an LLM already knows something, we don't include it.

See the [research repo](https://github.com/austintgriffith/ethskills-research) for baseline audits, gap analysis, and methodology.
