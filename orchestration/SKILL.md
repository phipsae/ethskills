# dApp Orchestration

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**SE2 has specific patterns you must follow.** Generic "build a dApp" advice won't work. SE2 auto-generates `deployedContracts.ts` — DON'T edit it. Use Scaffold hooks, NOT raw wagmi. External contracts go in `externalContracts.ts` BEFORE building the frontend.

**There are three phases. Never skip or combine them.** Contracts → Frontend → Production. Each has validation gates.

## The Three-Phase Build System

| Phase | Environment | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Local fork | Contracts + UI on localhost. Iterate fast. |
| **Phase 2** | Live network + local UI | Deploy contracts to mainnet/L2. Test with real state. Polish UI. |
| **Phase 3** | Production | Deploy frontend to IPFS/Vercel. Final QA. |

## Phase 1: Scaffold (Local)

### 1.1 Contracts

```bash
npx create-eth@latest my-dapp
cd my-dapp && yarn install
yarn chain          # Terminal 1: local node
yarn deploy         # Terminal 2: deploy contracts
```

**Critical steps:**
1. Write contracts in `packages/foundry/contracts/` (or `packages/hardhat/contracts/`)
2. Write deploy script
3. Add ALL external contracts to `packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts` — BEFORE Phase 1.2
4. Write tests (≥90% coverage)
5. Security audit before moving to frontend

**Validate:** `yarn deploy` succeeds. `deployedContracts.ts` auto-generated. Tests pass.

### 1.2 Frontend

```bash
yarn chain           # Terminal 1
yarn deploy --watch  # Terminal 2: auto-redeploy on changes
yarn start           # Terminal 3: Next.js at localhost:3000
```

**USE SCAFFOLD HOOKS, NOT RAW WAGMI:**

```typescript
// Read
const { data } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "balanceOf",
  args: [address],
  watch: true,
});

// Write
const { writeContractAsync, isMining } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");
await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: "swap",
  args: [tokenIn, tokenOut, amount],
  onBlockConfirmation: (receipt) => console.log("Done!", receipt),
});

// Events
const { data: events } = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "SwapExecuted",
  fromBlock: 0n,
  watch: true,
});
```

### The Three-Button Flow (MANDATORY)

Any token interaction shows ONE button at a time:
1. **Switch Network** (if wrong chain)
2. **Approve Token** (if allowance insufficient)
3. **Execute Action** (only after 1 & 2 satisfied)

Never show Approve and Execute simultaneously.

### UX Rules

- **Human-readable amounts:** `formatEther()` / `formatUnits()` for display, `parseEther()` / `parseUnits()` for contracts
- **Loading states everywhere:** `isLoading`, `isMining` on all async operations
- **Disable buttons during pending txs** (blockchains take 5-12s)
- **Never use infinite approvals** — approve exact amount or 3-5x
- **Helpful errors:** Parse "insufficient funds," "user rejected," "execution reverted" into plain language

**Validate:** Full user journey works with real wallet on localhost. All edge cases handled.

## Phase 2: Live Contracts + Local UI

1. Update `scaffold.config.ts`: `targetNetworks: [mainnet]` (or your L2)
2. Fund deployer: `yarn generate` → `yarn account` → send real ETH
3. Deploy: `yarn deploy --network mainnet`
4. Verify: `yarn verify --network mainnet`
5. Test with real wallet, small amounts ($1-10)
6. Polish UI — remove SE2 branding, custom styling

**Design rule:** NO LLM SLOP. No generic purple gradients. Make it unique.

**Validate:** Contracts verified on block explorer. Full journey works with real contracts.

## Phase 3: Production Deploy

### Pre-deploy Checklist
- `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: true` in scaffold.config.ts (CRITICAL — prevents burner wallet on prod)
- Update metadata (title, description, OG image 1200x630px)
- Restore any test values to production values

### Deploy

**IPFS (decentralized):**
```bash
yarn ipfs
# → https://YOUR_CID.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com
```

**Vercel (fast):**
```bash
cd packages/nextjs && vercel
```

### Production QA
- [ ] App loads on public URL
- [ ] Wallet connects, network switching works
- [ ] Read + write contract operations work
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Burner wallet NOT showing
- [ ] OG image works in link previews
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Tested with MetaMask, Rainbow, WalletConnect

## Phase Transition Rules

**Phase 3 bug → go back to Phase 2** (fix with local UI + prod contracts)
**Phase 2 contract bug → go back to Phase 1** (fix locally, write regression test, redeploy)
**Never hack around bugs in production.**
